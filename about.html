<h1>About This Application</h1>

<p>
<b>AN Telegram Report App</b> is an independent digital safety initiative created to assist individuals in responsibly reporting abusive, exploitative, and illegal activities occurring on Telegram. 
In the modern digital era, online platforms are increasingly used for communication and community building; however, they are also sometimes misused for harmful and unlawful activities.
</p>

<p>
This platform was developed to simplify the reporting process for users who encounter serious violations such as 
<span class="highlight">child sexual abuse material (CSAM), child exploitation, grooming, non-consensual intimate image sharing (NCII), harassment, and other forms of digital abuse.</span>
</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>Purpose of This Application</h2>

<p>
Many individuals who encounter harmful content do not know the correct reporting channels, the appropriate format for submitting complaints, or the official contact details of authorities. 
Stop Abuse aims to bridge that gap by providing a structured, guided, and accessible reporting interface.
</p>

<p>
By allowing users to paste Telegram links and select relevant violation categories, the application generates a properly formatted complaint that can be sent directly to official cybercrime authorities and Telegram's abuse response teams.
</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Core Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Enable faster and more structured reporting of illegal Telegram content.</li>
<li>Promote awareness about responsible digital citizenship.</li>
<li>Support child protection and online safety efforts.</li>
<li>Reduce the circulation of exploitative and harmful material.</li>
<li>Encourage lawful and ethical reporting practices.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>How the System Works</h2>

<p>
The application does not directly send reports from its own servers. Instead, it prepares a structured complaint message and opens the user's own email application. 
The user maintains full control and must manually confirm and send the report.
</p>

<p>
This ensures transparency, prevents misuse, and avoids unauthorized transmission of data. The system is designed to support lawful reporting rather than automate or manipulate complaint processes.
</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Privacy & Data Protection</h2>

<p>
Stop Abuse does <b>not collect, store, log, or process personal data</b>. No reports, email addresses, or Telegram links are stored on external servers. 
All actions occur locally through the user's device and email application.
</p>

<p>
User-provided details such as name or contact information are optional. The platform does not require account registration, login credentials, or background tracking.
</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Responsible Usage Policy</h2>

<p>
This tool is intended solely for lawful, responsible, and ethical reporting. False reporting, harassment, or misuse of this platform is strongly discouraged. 
Users are expected to act in good faith and ensure the accuracy of the information they submit.
</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Limitations & Independence</h2>

<p>
Stop Abuse is an independent initiative and is not affiliated with Telegram, government agencies, or law enforcement authorities. 
The application does not guarantee investigative outcomes or enforcement actions.
</p>

<p>
Its role is limited to simplifying and facilitating access to official reporting channels.
</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Community Responsibility</h2>

<p>
Digital safety is a shared responsibility. Authorities, platforms, and users must work together to maintain a secure online environment. 
Every responsible report contributes to the broader effort of reducing online abuse and protecting vulnerable individuals.
</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Emergency Situations</h2>

<p>
If a child or individual is in immediate danger, users are strongly advised to contact local law enforcement or emergency services without delay.
